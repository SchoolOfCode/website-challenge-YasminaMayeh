                    alternative rock, some hip hop, standard pop stuff. Play guitar so into all the guitar gods hendrix,
                    John frusciante, Johnny greenwood. Gaming - halo, fortnite, fifa, final fantasy, witcher, all the
                    good stuff!
                    Favourite films - bladerunner (both), arrival, the shining, Lord of the rings.
                    Massive Lord of the rings nerd, read the books, have the 4k extended remasters, read some of the
